### Summary 

##### Is our hotel revenue growing by year?
- Our hotel has shown some flunctuating revenue trends in the past few years. In 2018, we had low revenue figures, but things improved significantly in 2019. Then, in 2020, revenue dipped again compared to 2019, but it was still higher than what we earned in 2018. This shows that while we faced challenges in 2020, we managed to maintain better performance than the previous year.
