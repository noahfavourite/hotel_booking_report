### SUMMARY
##### Is our hotel revenue growing by year?
- Our hotel has shown some flunctuating revenue trends in the past few years. In 2018, we had low revenue figures, but things improved significantly in 2019. Then, in 2020, revenue dipped again compared to 2019, but it was still higher than what we earned in 2018. This shows that while we faced challenges in 2020, we managed to maintain better performance than the previous year.
##### Should we increase our parking lot size?
- There is currently no clear indication that the availability of parking spaces has a direct negative impact on our bookings, guest numbers, or overall revenue. While parking might be a convenience factor, there isn't enough evidence to suggest it significantly affects our key performance indicators.
##### Which of our customer type generates the most revenue?
- Transient customers contribute the highest revenue to the business. They are highly significant to our overall financial performance and it's important we cater to this segment
#### RECOMMENDATIONS
- We should develop personalized offers and discounts for our premium customers. Initiatives like these show our clients that they are valued and play a crucial role in our business growth. By expressing our appreciation, we are encouraging continued engagement.
- Before we invest in additional parking space, I recommend that we closely monitor revenue growth and identify any potential factors that could hinder it in the upcoming months.
- Further analysis should be carried out to understand the reasons behind the revenue decline in 2020. By identifying the underlying factors, we can develop targeted actions to manage impacts and improve our financial performance moving forward.
